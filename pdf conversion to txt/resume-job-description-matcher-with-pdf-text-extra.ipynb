Adjust `resume_pdf_path` and `job_text_path` to your files.  \n2. The notebook will extract, clean, embed, and print the similarity score.  \n3. Optionally, test with a provided list of sample sentences to see the model’s embedding behavior.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"pip install -U sentence-transformers","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-09-16T09:06:17.623588Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-09-16T09:06:17.624432Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-09-16T09:07:31.352410Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-09-16T09:06:17.624406Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-09-16T09:07:31.351261Z"},"collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true}},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"huggingface/tokenizers: The current process just got forked, after parallelism has already been used.
